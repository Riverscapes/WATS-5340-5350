# Intro to Birch Creek
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XA7iTzxAKcE9Pf9MA"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/birch/BirchFall.JPG"></a>

The WATS 5350 Spring 2020, 2021 and 2022 classes focused on [Birch Creek, Idaho](https://earth.app.goo.gl/n9RRA6) in southeast Idaho. Birch Creek is a left-bank tributary to Mink Creek, which is tributary to the Bear River just downstream of Oneida Narrows.  The project is on landowner and rancher Jay Wilde's deeded ground.  

Jay is excited to see if the success of beaver reintroduction facilitated by low-tech BDAs on Birch Creek on USFS land upstream of his ranch can be extended downstream on to his own property. **The goals of this project are to improve riverscape health and restore perennial flow.**

## Part 1 - Why we can even work in Birch Creek

For WATS 5350, this video sets the stage for Birch Creek, the previous project with Jay Wilde upstream on USFS land, the motivation for that project, the results of that project and why there is trust to move down off the Forest and on to Jay's private, deeded property and continue with the project you will be planning, designing (and should be building if not for COVID-19, but can come and build in the summer if you want).

### Jay Wilde's Story: Reintroducing beaver to bring back perennial flow 

<a href="https://earth.app.goo.gl/n9RRA6"><img width="100" class="float-left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/wilde-round_9.png"></a>
We have had the privilege of working with Idaho Rancher Jay Wilde since 2014.  For a more elaborate version of what I explain in the 45 minute above, its best to hear directly from Jay what happened and why he's willing to let you go "mess up" and improve the health of his creek. Jay tells his [story](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Workshops/CheapCheerful/2018/NRCS/Idaho/Lectures/2018_IdahoNRCS_Wilde_BirchCreek.pdf) about bringing beaver back to the creek he grew up on to restore flow.  Jay went on the road in the summer of 2018 with us and helped spread this message to workshop participants in five SGI Low-Tech Process Based Restoration of Mesic & Riparian Workshops. This video below is from the [Logan Workshop](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/logan-workshop-materials.html):

#### Story Told by Others
This story has appeared in multiple media outlets. Here are a few of the recent ones:

##### Beef Magazine: Beaver power provides year-long water to Idaho ranch
[<img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/birch/Beef_Birch.png">](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Courses/WATS5350/Lowtech/birch/BEEF+30-31+april+REVISED.pdf)
That's right, [Beef Magazine](https://www.beefmagazine.com/sustainability/beaver-power-provides-year-long-water-idaho-ranch)! This article by Briana Randall titled "[Beaver power provides year-long water to Idaho ranch: Beavers? You read that right. Here’s how four-legged engineers helped restore an Idaho ranch.](https://www.beefmagazine.com/sustainability/beaver-power-provides-year-long-water-idaho-ranch)" explains to other cattlemen why Jay wants what many view as a nuisance on his ranch.

##### National Wildlife Federation Magazine
In this article titled ""[Nature's Ecosystem Engineers Beaver dams create climate-smart wetlands that benefit wildlife and people](https://www.nwf.org/Magazines/National-Wildlife/2020/August-September/Conservation/Beavers)", Catherine Arnold highlights Jay's story on Birch Creek.

## Part 2 - Birch Creek Project Objectives & Conservation Planning Process

<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Courses/WATS5350/2020/Week8_BirchCreekIntro_2.pdf"><img class="float-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lectures/2020-WATS5350_Week8_Part2.png"></a>
This outlines the project reach, walks you through a fly through of the reach, lays out the restoration goals and objectives, and reminds you of the low-tech PBR [conservation planning process]({{ site.baseurl }}/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/planning.html) you will follow to get the project done. 

The video is about 35 minutes. Please post any questions you have to the [planning discussion board](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/567581/discussion_topics/1982817) in Canvas.
