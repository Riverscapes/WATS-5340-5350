## Background


Despite tens of billions of dollars being spent annually on restoring riverscapes, we are nowhere near scratching the scope of the problem. There is way more work that needs to be done than we are getting done. Restoration tends to be primarily implemented with funding from grants and program-specific contracts. The vast majority of restoration funding comes from revenue from taxpayers and/or rate-payers (e.g., utilities) and a variety of mechanisms are used to make awards and get projects implemented. However, these standard methods of procurement are typically subject to local, state, and/or federal contracting guidelines and limitations, and are difficult to organize for larger projects or plan for phased implementation. The current pace of spending and action is far too little.

Similar problems exist in restoring forests. Some innovative thinkers from [Blue Forest Conservation](https://www.blueforestconservation.com/) developed a Forest Resilience Bond as a mechanism to tackle some similar challenges faced in forest restoration.


We are working with Blue Forest Conservation to expand the concept to other forms of restoration (riverscape, watershed, and rangelands), and are working on getting projects going right here in the Bear River Watershed. You are going to be working on one LTPBR project at the heart of this effort. Blue Forest co-founder and COO [Nick Wobbrock](https://www.blueforest.org/meet-the-team) and Senior Project Associate [Peter Wyrsch](https://www.blueforest.org/meet-the-team) have generously offered to come meet with you and share these innovative conservation financing mechanisms that could become critical tools in scaling up restoration efforts in your future.
