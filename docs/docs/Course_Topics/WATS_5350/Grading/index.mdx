## Background

#### Synopsis of Topic

[![Grading Plan](/img/eg/17_Grading+Plan.png)](https://www.wetlands.com/technology/) Your primary project for the traditional restoration project this semester will be to produce a grading plan.

#### Why we're covering it

To give you first hand experience in converting conceptual designs into actual grading and construction documents that can be put out to bid and an engineering contractor can read, interpret and build from for a real restoration project.

#### Learning Outcomes

1. Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management, wetland restoration) with practitioners.
2. Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are designed, constructed, evaluated and adaptively managed.
3. Develop a working *understanding* of different aspects and approaches to **restoration design** and *create* two types of design and *evaluate* their ability to achieve project objectives. *Articulate* specific, testable **design hypotheses** for your own designs.
