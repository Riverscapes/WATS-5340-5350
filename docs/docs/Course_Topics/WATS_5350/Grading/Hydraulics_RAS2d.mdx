## Hydraulic Simulation of Logan River [Kunzler Reach](https://fluvial.joewheaton.org/2018-course-topics/curtis-creek---delft3d-hydraulic-model-lab)

Tyler Allred ([Allred Restoration](http://www.allred-restoration.com/)) was generous enough to prepare a Hydraulic model ([HEC-RAS2d](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/)) of this year's restoration reach for us.

### Reference Resources

Here is an expanded set of slides from a workshop Peter and Joe taught, where the grading exercise was extended to run a hydraulic model on.

If you wish to use the HEC-RAS 2D model yourself, you may find the West Consultants manual helpful:

- West Consultants, Inc, 2016. [Two-Dimensional Modeling Using HEC-RAS](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Courses/WATS5350/Two-Dimensional_Modeling_Using_HEC-RAS.pdf), American Society of Civil Engineers, and West Consultants.

Courses on hydraulics and open channel flow are highly recommended to build your theoretical understanding and proficiency in running hydraulic models. You might find the resources on [Fluvial Hydraulics](http://fluvial.joewheaton.org) helpful. There are a variety of tutorials for running 2D hydraulic models you can find there:

- [Tutorial for Delft3D](http://fluvial.joewheaton.org/2014-course-topics/curtis-creek---delft3d-hydraulic-model-lab)
- [Tutorial for IRIC](http://fluvial.joewheaton.org/assignments/iricfastmech-2dhydraulicmodelinglabofcurtiscreek)
