## Join us April 23, 2022 to Volunteer for Construction

The [2022 Capstone Class (WATS 5350/6350)](/Syllabus/2022_Spring) and the [2022 LTPBR Implementation Class (WATS 5624/CEWA 5624)](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2022/USU/WATS-5624/) courses will be building the next phase of Birch Creek LTPBR on Jay Wilde's [Diamondback W Ranch](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/casestudies/birch.html)! The [2022 Capstone students](/Syllabus/2022_Spring) have completed and prepared a full planning assessment, design and permit application, and will be building as much of their design as is possible on Saturday. They will also have the help of an extra dozen or so students from the [2022 Capstone Class (WATS 5350/6350)](/Syllabus/2022_Spring).

**Meet at 8:00 AM at Parking Lot at Birch Creek**

If you wish to join us for all or part of the day, please [register here](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/volunteer) and denote you are interested in this specific event in the form.

## What do I need to bring?

### Field Gear

Your safety is our top priority, but you are the most important person in ensuring your safety and comfort. So bring common sense. This is Spring in the mountains. You should be prepared for anything from sunny skies and sunburn, to snow and hypothermia (yes we've already had our first snow-storms, and yes we will work in the snow). The current forecast is for rain. We will be hiking through and doing work in small, cold, wadeable streams.

1. We **strongly recommend a pair of chest waders and wading boots**, to keep you warm and dry. If you cannot get a pair of waders, please [email Mike Clawson](mailto:MikeClawson3@gmail.com) and we will see what we can find.
2. You also should bring whatever outdoor clothing and gear to keep yourself comfortable. Layers, coats, gloves, hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a dry change of clothes and footwear for afterwards are all a must. No open-toed shoes will be allowed.
3. Wear work clothing suitable for a construction site.

We will provide you with basic [personal protective equipment](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module5#d-logistics-equipment--safety) (PPEs like work gloves, eye protection, hard hats, ear protection). However, if you have any of your own personal PPE you are more comfortable in, please bring it.

If you have any allergies or medical conditions that we should be aware of, please notify us of those when filling out your [volunteer form](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/volunteer).

### Lunch and Snacks

Please bring your own lunch and snacks to keep you going throughout the day. You will also want to bring plenty of water and a refillable water bottle (we will have some water jugs for refilling).
