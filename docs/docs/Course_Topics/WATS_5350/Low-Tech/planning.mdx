We returned to the basic planning steps from the typical [restoration process](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Restoration_Process.md) we introduced [last semester](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/index.md). Here we use the USDA's Natural Resource Conservation Service's [Conservation Planning Process](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/cp/) (NRCS, 2007), as an example of the restoration planning process and then elaborate on what aspects of that process are distinctive for low-tech restoration.
