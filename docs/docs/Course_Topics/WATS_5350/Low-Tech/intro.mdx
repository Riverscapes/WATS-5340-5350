title: Introduction to Low-Tech PBR of Riverscapes
sidebar_position: 2
---

## Introduction

We first introduced low-tech process-based restoration (PBR) by defining it and talking about:
- the primary impairment it addresses: **structurally-starved riverscapes**
- the primary processes promoted with low-tech PBR: **wood accumulation** and **beaver dam activity**
- the typical structures used to reverse structural starvation

### Course Reference – WATS 5620


For reference, also see the online, self-paced materials associated with the popular [2020 Virtual Workshop](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/). Graduate students and professionals take a more in-depth version of this in the 1 credit, [WATS 5620](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2021/USU/WATS-5620/):

## Past Years' Resources


### 2020 Content
In Fall 2019 WATS 5340, we introduced the topic of low-tech PBR in the [Principles topics](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Principles.html#slides--handouts). As such, we didn't cover it again in the Spring (WATS 5350), but we draw your attention to it here. We did not give an introduction to the different types of low-tech treatments, and we provide that lecture here:


#### Low-Tech Structures

Having previously covered [principles](http://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Principles.html#slides--handouts), we work through the diversity of low-tech approaches and structure types in this lecture so you have a handle on what you're going to be using in your designs.

This talk is elaborated in [Chapter 1](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap01) & [Chapter 4](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap04) of the design manual.
