## Background to Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration

### Synopsis of Topic


![Low-Tech PBR](/img/PBR_LT_cc_100w.png)

Our second project this semester will be a [low-tech](https://www.sagegrouseinitiative.com/what-is-low-tech-stream-restoration/) restoration project.

### Why we're covering it

To give you first hand experience in designing, building and developing an adaptive management plan for a real restoration project.

### Learning Outcomes


1. Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management, wetland restoration) with practitioners.
2. Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are designed, constructed, evaluated and adaptively managed.
3. Develop a working *understanding* of different aspects and approaches to **restoration design** and *create* two types of design and *evaluate* their ability to achieve project objectives. *Articulate* specific, testable **design hypotheses** for your own designs.
4. Get first-hand experience **constructing & implementing** a ‚Äòcheap and cheerful‚Äô restoration project by *building* structures you *designed*.
5. Understand the principles of **Post Project Appraisals and Monitoring** and how to evaluate overall restoration objectives and test design hypotheses.
6. *Apply* the evaluation and adjust loops of an **Adaptive Management Plan** to see how the process of learning-by-doing can work.
