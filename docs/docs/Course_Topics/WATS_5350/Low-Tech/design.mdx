This 55 minute lecture is based on the same [lecture](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/Materials/Intro/materials.html#11-design) we give in the [3-day Low-Tech PBR of Riverscapes introduction class](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/). In it, we cover:

- Context for design
- What does a design need to do
- What are key elements of a restoration design
- How do you formulate a design?
- Show some examples of how it's done.

## Examples of Design & Implementation Reports
Below are good examples of real reports you can base your design and  implementation reports for low-tech PBR projects on. These are based on the guidleines we reviewed in class and laid out in the manual (i.e. [Chapter 5](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap05) and [Chapter 6](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap06) of [design manual](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/)):
