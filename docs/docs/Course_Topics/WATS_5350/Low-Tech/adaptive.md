Originally, we discussed doing a post-project appraisal next week. Instead, we have decided to have you expand your [Design Report](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/531745/assignments/2634059) to include:

- **As Built Documentation**
- **An Adaptive Management Plan, which includes:**
  - Conceptual Model & Project Hypotheses (in addition to detailed Design Hypotheses already in your report)
  - Monitoring & Maintenance necessary to test those hypotheses
  - Trigger points for maintenance or next-phase actions ([see these figures](https://usu.box.com/v/AdaptiveManagementFigs) that you can modify)

You will prepare an Adaptive Beaver Management Plan modeled loosely after the Portugal et al. (2015) Pine Creek Plan in ยง8:

- Portugal E, Wheaton JM and Bouwes N. 2015. [Technical Report: Pine Creek Watershed Scoping Plan for Restoration: Using Beaver Dam Analogs and High-Density LWD to Initiate Process-Based Stream Recovery](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272829372_Pine_Creek_Watershed_Scoping_Plan_for_Restoration_Using_Beaver_Dam_Analogs_and_High-Density_LWD_to_Initiate_Process-Based_Stream_Recovery). Prepared for the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs. Logan UT, 52 pp. DOI: [10.13140/RG.2.1.1607.9527](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1607.9527)

## What to Submit

You should submit an updated version of your report with the above adaptive management and monitoring plan sections added to it. Please submit this plan by **Wednesday April 18**, so that Peter can provide detailed feedback for you on **Friday, April 20**.
