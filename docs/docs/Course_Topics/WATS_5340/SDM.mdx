The most relevant [learning outcomes](/Syllabus/Learning_Outcomes) for this unit is (5), but that feeds into (1) and (3).

1. Gain direct experience *applying* knowledge as a watershed scientist to working on real-world aquatic ecosystem **restoration and management problems** (e.g. stream restoration, watershed management,wetland restoration) with practitioners. 
2. Build a working *understanding* of the typical **process** through which restoration projects are conceived, proposed, planned, permitted and conceptually designed. 
3. Objectively *evaluate* and *analyze* the scientific, political, economic and feasibility **tradeoffs of various approaches to restoration** in a specific project context and gain an appreciation of working with diverse stakeholders. *Synthesize* this analysis through a **planning process** that **prioritizes specific restoration and management actions** throughout a watershed.
