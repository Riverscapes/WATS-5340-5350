## WATS 5340 Topics

Students learn the application of the principles, theory, and skills of Watershed Science to aquatic ecosystem management and restoration projects.

From Fall 2017 through Fall 2019 the Fall WATS 5340 course ran the entire semester and was co-taught by Peter Wilcock & Joe Wheaton. We covered the following topics (kept here for reference for past students and as an alternative reference for existing): 

- [Course Overview](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Overview)
- [Restoration Process](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Restoration_Process)
- [Condition & Impairment Assessment](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Condition)
- [Evaluating Recovery Potential](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Recovery_Potential)
- [Structured Decision Making & Objective Definition](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/SDM)
- [Permitting](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Permitting)
- [Visioning Restoration Alternative](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Visioning)
- [Conceptual Design Alternatives Project](/Course_Topics/WATS_5340/Project)

In **Fall 2020**, we changed things up as follows:
- Added  [Principles of Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/595865), 2 credit prerequisite  (WATS 4950 ) for first 5 weeks of semester
- Course taught over last 10 weeks of semester, with first field field trips combined with Restoration 
- Peter Wilcock - Lead Instructor and Joe Wheaton - Supporting Instructor
