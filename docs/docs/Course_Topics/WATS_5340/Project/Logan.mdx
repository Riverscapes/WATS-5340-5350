### Some Helpful Videos of Area Flooding in 2017 High Flows

#### [600 West Flooding 3/23/17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vam1TIG1hf0)


<YouTubeEmbed videoId="vam1TIG1hf0" title="600 West Flooding 3/23/17" />

- 0:00 – 2:00 and 4:00 – end show flooding between 6th W (Park Ave) and 10th W on Kunzler (north of river), ICON and City properties (south of river). Video starts at 6th W looking east then pans north and west.

#### [1000 West Flooding 3/23/17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMzuNltyUeg#t=5.482027)

- The video starts at 10th W and pans briefly to the east showing flooding of Kunzler property east of the highway (ICON is large white building south of the river). A short portion of the video returns to this area (around 2:15) but most of it (2:15 - shows flooding of Kunzler properties west of 10th W (as well as flooding on ICON south of the river east of 10th W). The Logan River is outlined by the crack willow trees. At 3:30 you can see a small, straight drainage and small line of trees at the middle.

We don't currently have GIS shapefiles for you. If you want to georeference images and trace, you might take a look at [this old lab](http://gis.joewheaton.org/assignments/labs/old-labs/Georeferencing).

## What about _Salix fragillis_?

Crack Willow (Salix fragilis) is native to Europe and Asia, not North America. 

Some info:

Crack Willow (_Salix fragilis_) Issues and Management Strategies](http://www.loganutah.org/departments/parkrec/LoganRiveratRendezvousPark,ChannelandFloodplainRestorationCrackWillowIssuesandManagementStrategies.pdf) - Prepared by Darren Olsen for Logan River Task Force
- [CABI Infasive Species Compendium Entry for crack willow](

- [Crack Willow Invasive Plant Infromation]
(http://www.badplants.com/show/plant/Crack-Willow/357)
- [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salix_fragilis) - From [BadPlants.com](http://badplants.com)

These are useful information on treatments for Crack Willow:
